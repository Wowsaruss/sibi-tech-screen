A collection of simple techinical questions to help us learn more about you!

In `src/underbar.js` are 3 functions "each","filter", and "map"

Your job is to implement each function.  

Your functions will be used for the tests listed below located in `spec/part1.js`

### Each

1) should iterate over arrays, providing access to the element, index, and array itself
2) should only iterate over the array elements, not properties of the array
3) should iterate over objects, providing access to the element, index, and object itself

### Filter

1) should return all even numbers in an array
2) should return all odd numbers in an array
3) should produce a brand new array instead of modifying the input array

### Map
1) should apply a function to every value in an array
2) should produce a brand new array instead of modifying the input array

Once defined open `SpecRunner.html` in a web browser.  If you have properly defined the functions all tests will indicate passed.
